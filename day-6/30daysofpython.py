tpl = ('item 1','item 2','item 3')
# there are only a few method when using tuples
# tuples are ordered and unmodifiable
# tuple() --- to create a new tuple
# count() --- returns the instances of a certain item
# index() --- returns the index of certain item

# empty_tuple = ()
# # OR #
# empty_tuple = tuple()

# tpl = ('item1', 'item2', 'item3')
# print(len(tpl))

# removing a certain item from a tuple is not possible however we can delete the whole tuple

# tpl1 = ('Arsanyos',{'meoe':12},False)
# del tpl1
# print(tpl1)  ---- > retuns NameError because we have deleted tpl1 the python is asking if we meant tpl since no tuple with name tpl1 
# exists anymore
